  "readme": "# Relay for luxalpa network\n\nThis is a node for luxalpa network that stores the entire database and forwards new storage units to peers.  The relay does not hold any private keys and cannot send payments itself.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall node.js, clone the repository, then say\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\nIf you want to accept incoming connections (you probably want), set up a proxy, such as nginx, to forward all websocket connections on a specific path to your daemon running the relay code.  See example configuration for nginx in [core](../../../core) documentation.\n\n## Run\n```sh\nnode start.js > log &\n```\n## Customize\n\nIf you want to change any defaults, refer to the documentation of [core](../../../core), the core luxalpa library `require()`'d from here.\n",
